‚ú® Features
Fast SYN Scanning: Multithreaded port scanning using TCP SYN packets for efficient detection

OS Fingerprinting: Identifies operating systems through TTL value analysis

Cross-Platform: Works seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS

Flexible Targeting: Scan specific ports, ranges, or custom port lists

Stealthy Operations: Uses SYN scanning instead of full TCP connections

Comprehensive Reporting: Detailed output with OS detection and open port listings
